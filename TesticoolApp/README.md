### Key Components

#### 1. **BluetoothManager.swift**
Handles all Bluetooth communication using CoreBluetooth framework.

**Responsibilities:**
- Scanning for HM-10 devices
- Connecting/disconnecting
- Sending commands (`ON`, `OFF`, `SPEED:xxx`, `STATUS`)
- Receiving and parsing responses
- Auto-polling status every 5 seconds

**HM-10 BLE Configuration:**
```swift
serviceUUID = "FFE0"           // HM-10 default service
txCharacteristicUUID = "FFE1"  // Device TX (app receives)
rxCharacteristicUUID = "FFE1"  // Device RX (app sends)
```

#### 2. **DeviceState.swift**
Observable object that holds current device state.

**Published Properties:**
- `isPumpOn: Bool` - Pump running state
- `pumpSpeed: Int` - PWM value (0-255)
- `temperature: Double` - Current temperature in ¬∞C
- `runtimeSeconds: Int` - Elapsed runtime
- `remainingSeconds: Int` - Time until auto-shutoff
- `errorMessage: String?` - Current error (if any)

#### 3. **StatusParser.swift**
Parses incoming firmware messages into structured data.

**Supported Formats:**
```
STATUS:{State:ON,Speed:70%,Runtime:5m,Remaining:25m,Temp:34.5C}
PUMP:ON / PUMP:OFF
TEMP:34.5
ERROR:SAFETY_SHUTOFF
MANUAL:ON / MANUAL:OFF
```

#### 4. **Views**
SwiftUI views that compose the user interface.

- **ContentView** - Root view, switches between connection and control screens
- **PumpControlView** - Main control interface with ON/OFF button and speed slider
- **StatusView** - Session timer with progress ring and status rows
- **SettingsView** - Device info, safety guides, and about section

## Bluetooth Protocol

### Command Format

Commands are ASCII strings terminated by newline (`\n`).

### Commands (App ‚Üí Device)

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `ON` | Turn pump ON at default speed | `ON\n` |
| `OFF` | Turn pump OFF | `OFF\n` |
| `STATUS` | Request full status update | `STATUS\n` |
| `TEMP` | Request temperature reading | `TEMP\n` |
| `SPEED:<value>` | Set pump speed (0-255) | `SPEED:180\n` |

### Responses (Device ‚Üí App)

| Response | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OK` | Command acknowledged | `OK` |
| `ERROR:<msg>` | Error occurred | `ERROR:SAFETY_SHUTOFF` |
| `STATUS:{...}` | Status data packet | `STATUS:{State:ON,Speed:70%,Runtime:5m,Remaining:25m,Temp:34.5C}` |
| `TEMP:<value>` | Temperature in Celsius | `TEMP:34.5` |
| `PUMP:ON/OFF` | Pump state notification | `PUMP:ON` |
| `MANUAL:ON/OFF` | Manual button pressed | `MANUAL:ON` |

### Auto-Polling

The app automatically requests `STATUS` every **5 seconds** when connected. This keeps the UI synchronized with the device state, even when controlled manually via physical buttons.

## Customization

### Changing Bluetooth UUIDs

If your HM-10 module uses different UUIDs, edit `BluetoothManager.swift`:

```swift
// Line ~39-41
private let serviceUUID = CBUUID(string: "YOUR_SERVICE_UUID")
private let txCharacteristicUUID = CBUUID(string: "YOUR_TX_UUID")
private let rxCharacteristicUUID = CBUUID(string: "YOUR_RX_UUID")
```

### Changing Device Name

To connect to a different device name, edit `BluetoothManager.swift`:

```swift
// Line ~44
private let targetDeviceName = "Your_Device_Name"
```

### Adjusting Status Polling Interval

To change how often status is requested (default 5 seconds):

```swift
// Line ~49
private let statusPollingInterval: TimeInterval = 5.0
```

### Styling and Colors

All colors use SwiftUI's semantic colors for automatic dark mode support:

- Primary accent: `.blue` (iOS system blue)
- Success: `.green`
- Warning: `.orange`
- Error: `.red`

To customize, search and replace color values in the Views files.

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Build

**Error:** "No such module 'CoreBluetooth'"
- **Solution:** CoreBluetooth is a system framework, no import needed. Make sure you're targeting iOS (not macOS).

**Error:** "Info.plist not found"
- **Solution:** Ensure `Info.plist` is in the project root and added to the target.

### Bluetooth Issues

**Problem:** "No devices found" when scanning
- ‚úÖ Ensure you're running on a **physical iOS device** (not simulator)
- ‚úÖ Grant Bluetooth permissions when prompted
- ‚úÖ Check that Arduino device is powered on
- ‚úÖ Verify HM-10 module is advertising (LED should blink)
- ‚úÖ Check HM-10 service UUID matches (`FFE0` is default)

**Problem:** "Failed to connect"
- ‚úÖ Move closer to the device (within 10 meters)
- ‚úÖ Restart the Arduino device
- ‚úÖ Toggle Bluetooth off/on in iOS Settings
- ‚úÖ Restart the app

**Problem:** "Commands not working"
- ‚úÖ Check Serial Monitor on Arduino for incoming commands
- ‚úÖ Verify baud rate is 9600 in firmware
- ‚úÖ Ensure characteristic UUIDs are correct

### UI Issues

**Problem:** SwiftUI previews not showing
- ‚úÖ Click "Resume" in the canvas
- ‚úÖ Clean build folder (‚åò‚áßK)
- ‚úÖ Restart Xcode

**Problem:** Status not updating
- ‚úÖ Check Bluetooth connection is active
- ‚úÖ Verify device is sending STATUS responses
- ‚úÖ Look for errors in Xcode console

## Development Notes

### Adding New Features

**To add a new command:**

1. Add command method in `BluetoothManager.swift`:
   ```swift
   func sendNewCommand() {
       sendCommand("NEW_CMD")
   }
   ```

2. Add response handling in `parseResponse()`:
   ```swift
   else if response.hasPrefix("NEW_CMD:") {
       // Parse response
   }
   ```

3. Update UI to call the new method

**To add a new view:**

1. Create new file in `Views/` folder
2. Import SwiftUI and add `@EnvironmentObject var bluetoothManager`
3. Build your view
4. Add navigation link from appropriate parent view

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging by checking Xcode console output. All Bluetooth operations are logged with `[BT]` prefix:

```
[BT] Started scanning for devices...
[BT] Discovered: Testicool_Prototype (RSSI: -45)
[BT] Connected to Testicool_Prototype
[BT] Sent command: ON
[BT] Received: PUMP:ON
```
